# Synopsis Format Documentation

This document describes the standard format and structure used in the project synopsis.

---

## üìå Structure of the Synopsis

The synopsis is organized into **five main sections**, each serving a specific purpose.

### 1. Title of Project
- Provides the full title of the project.
- Clearly states the main theme or technology being used.
- Example:  
  `Secure Authentication Backend Using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL to generate JWTs for authentication`

---

### 2. Problem Statement
- Explains the **motivation and need** for the project.
- Highlights **existing challenges/limitations** in current systems.
- Lists shortcomings in **bullet points** for clarity.
- Concludes with how the proposed project will address these issues.

Structure:
- **Introduction to the problem** (context, importance).  
- **Limitations of current systems** (bullet points).  
- **Proposed solution** (with features in bullet points).  

---

### 3. Methodology / Technology / Tools to be used
- Specifies **languages, frameworks, and tools** required.  
- Subdivided into categories like:
  - **Programming Language**
  - **Frameworks (e.g., Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA)**
  - **Libraries/Packages (e.g., JWT, BCrypt)**
  - **Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, H2 for testing)**
  - **External Tools (e.g., Postman, Docker)**
  - **Monitoring Tools (e.g., Spring Actuator)**

Format:  
- Each item listed with **purpose/usage** explained.  
- Example:  
  `Spring Security: Handles authentication, authorization, and role-based access.`

---

### 4. Expected Outcome
- Outlines the **deliverables and functional results** of the project.  
- Written in bullet points.  
- Covers:
  - Core project functionality (e.g., JWT authentication, RBAC).  
  - Security features (e.g., password hashing, email verification).  
  - Supporting features (e.g., logout/invalidation, Swagger docs).  
  - Deployment readiness.  

---

### 5. Team
- Lists **faculty mentor(s)** with name and designation.  
- Provides **student details**:
  - Name  
  - Roll number  
- Space for **signatures**.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Formatting Conventions
- Sections are **numbered** (1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶).  
- Important features/points are listed in **bullets**.  
- Technology/tool list is grouped by category with **purpose specified**.  
- Outcomes are **action-oriented statements** (e.g., ‚ÄúUsers can register and log in‚Ä¶‚Äù).  
- Formal academic/professional tone is maintained.  

---

## üìñ Example Use Case
This format is suitable for:
- Academic project submissions.  
- Industry project proposals.  
- Internal documentation of backend/security projects.
