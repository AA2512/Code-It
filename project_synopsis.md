# Synopsis

## 1. Title of Project
**Intelligent Search Engine for Data Structures and Algorithms Problems Using BM25 Algorithm and Natural Language Processing**

---

## 2. Problem Statement
The current landscape of competitive programming and DSA learning platforms presents several challenges for students and developers seeking specific problem solutions:

**Limitations of current systems:**
- **Manual browsing inefficiency**: Users must manually navigate through thousands of problems to find relevant ones
- **Keyword mismatch issues**: Simple text search often fails due to terminology variations and problem descriptions
- **Limited semantic understanding**: Existing search systems lack the ability to understand problem context and relationships
- **Poor relevance ranking**: Search results don't prioritize problems based on actual relevance to user queries
- **Inconsistent problem categorization**: Problems from different platforms (LeetCode, InterviewBit, TechDelight) lack unified search capabilities
- **Resource authenticity concerns**: Difficulty in verifying the credibility and accuracy of problem solutions and explanations from various sources

**Proposed solution:**
- **Intelligent search engine** that understands DSA problem context and user intent
- **Advanced text processing** with spell-check, lemmatization, and stopword removal
- **BM25 ranking algorithm** for optimal relevance scoring based on term frequency and document importance
- **Multi-platform integration** combining problems from LeetCode, InterviewBit, and TechDelight
- **Smart query expansion** with number-to-word conversion and camelCase detection
